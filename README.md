## Suppose of the Project

* The Suppose of this Project is to offer an easy to use function to perform pivot like transformations on some data set and save the resulting dataframe structure for a later use in for example a machine learning pipeline. For this Case it is possible to save and load the data structure and perform the same transformations on new data.

## Classes

* pivot_table(): creates the object. It is initialized with standard parameters but can also already define the columns to be grouped by, the aggregat function which should be used.

### Functions

* fit(df=None, c_group=None, c_pivot=None, aggrfunc=np.sum): Takes the dataframe and learns the resulting structure.
* save_pivot(filename): Saves the data structure in byte format on the terminated place.
* load_pivot(link): Loads the pretrained "model" in the class from a defined file.
* transform(df=None): Performs the data transformation with new data.


## Usage

1. Download the python file
2. Put the file in your project directory
3. integrate it with "import ml_pivot"
4. Build an instance for example: "pivot = ml_pivot.pivot_table() "
5. Train the model for example: "df_pivoted = pivot.fit("your dataframe","your grouping columns","your aggregated column",["your aggregate function"])"
6. save the model : "pivot.save_pivot("your file adress") "
7. load the model : new_pivot = ml_pivot.pivot_table().load_pivot("your file adress")
8. aggregate new data : new_df_pivoted = new_pivot.transform("your dataframe with new data")
